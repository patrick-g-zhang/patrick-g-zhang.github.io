A Study on the Efficacy of Model Pre-training in Developing Neural Text-to-Speech System
</h1>


<div class="container">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
In the development of neural text-to-speech systems, model pre-training with a large amount of non-target speakers' data is a common approach. However, in terms of ultimately achieved system performance for target speaker(s), the actual benefits of model pre-training are uncertain and unstable, depending very much on the quantity and text content of training data. This study aims to understand better why and how model pre-training can positively contribute to TTS system performance. It is postulated that the pre-training process plays a critical role in learning text-related variation in speech, while further training with the target speaker's data aims to capture the speaker-related variation. Different test sets are created with varying degrees of similarity to target speaker data in terms of text content. Experiments show that leveraging a speaker-independent TTS trained on speech data with diverse text content can improve the target speaker TTS on domain-mismatched text. We also attempt to reduce the amount of pre-training data for a new text domain and improve the data and computational efficiency. It is found that the TTS system could achieve comparable performance when the pre-training data is reduced to 1/8 of its original size.

    <b>TTS with pre-training:</b> The system is built by applying 24-hour target speaker data to fine-tune a speaker-independent model pre-trained with 960-hour LibriSpeech.

  <h2>Part 3. Pre-training Data reduction</h2>
    <i>
    These examples are randomly sampled from the MOS and CMOS evaluation set for <b>Table 4</b> in the paper.
    </i>

    </br>
    All four target speaker TTS systems are fine-tuned  from  pre-trained speaker-independent TTS models. The only difference between those systems is the pre-training data:

    </br>
    <b>Random:</b> 40,000 pairs data randomly sampled from the LibriSpeech </br>
    <b>Full:</b> Full 960-hour LibriSpeech. </br>
    <b>Prepexity-based:</b> 40,000 pairs data sampled fromLibriSpeech with the method described in subsection 4.1 of the paper </br>
    <b>Bert-based:</b> 40,000 pair data selected from LibriSpeech using the method described in subsection 4.2 of the paper </br>
