MIXED-PHONEME BERT: IMPROVING BERT WITH MIXED PHONEME ANDSUP-PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS FOR TEXT TO SPEECH
</h1>


<div class="container">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
Recently, leveraging BERT pre-training to improve the phoneme encoder in text to speech (TTS) has drawn increasing attention.  However, current works remain several flaws: 1) some works directly apply pre-training with character-based units to enhance phoneme encoder, which causes the inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning since TTS encoder takes phoneme as input instead of character-based units; 2) some of them focus on phoneme-level pre-training, which can alleviate the input mismatch but lack the ability to modelling rich representations and sematic information due to limited phoneme vocabulary. In this paper, we propose Mixed-Phoneme BERT, a novel variant of  BERT model that uses mixed phoneme and sup-phoneme representations to enhance the learning capability. Specifically, we merge the adjacent phonemes into sup-phonemes (which have a much larger vocabulary size than that of phonemes), and combine the phoneme sequence and the merged sup-phoneme sequence together as the model input, which can enhance the model capacity to learn rich contextual representations due to increased vocabulary size. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed Mixed-Phoneme BERT significantly improves the TTS performance with 0.296 CMOS gain compared with the FastSpeech 2 baseline and 0.111 CMOS gain compared with the Phoneme BERT with only phoneme-level pre-training.
